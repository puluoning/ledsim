# LEDSIM #
Originally named Light Emitting Diode Simulator Implemented in MATLAB, now a Python-based tool for simulating III-Nitride based LEDs. III-Nitride LEDs are of particular importance due to their ability to generate blue light with high efficiency; combined with wavelength-converting materials such as phosphors, these LEDs can be used to make emitters of white light with efficiency far exceeding incandescent or fluorescent sources.

LEDSIM allows calculation of band diagrams, current-voltage characteristics, radiative efficiency, and loss channels for III-Nitride LEDs. The basic method involves the self-consistent solution of the Poisson equation with continuitiy equations for electrons and holes. Carrier densities and recombination rates are calculated classically. Current and voltage boundary conditions are supported.

This project represents a work in progress, and is updated on an intermittent basis as progress is made. Ongoing work is aimed at incorporating quantum-mechanical elements in the description of carrier transport and recombination.
